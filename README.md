# README.md
# tx-fee-soundness

## Overview
This repository contains a simple Python script that verifies the soundness of an Ethereum transaction by fetching its receipt, displaying execution details, and computing the **total transaction fee**.  
It provides a minimal but clear way to inspect a transaction’s **economic footprint** and confirm that its state matches across RPC endpoints.

## Features
- Connects to any Ethereum-compatible RPC endpoint
- Displays key transaction info: from, to, block, status
- Calculates gas price, gas used, and total fee in ETH
- Shows confirmations and timestamp
- Detects pending transactions
- Useful for developers verifying transaction finality and consistency

## Installation
1. Install Python 3.10 or higher.
2. Install dependency:

   ### CLI options

Some useful flags:

- `--rpc`: HTTP RPC endpoint (required)
- `--timeout`: RPC request timeout in seconds (default: 10)
- `--min-confirmations`: Require at least N confirmations
- `--short`: Print a single-line summary
- `--no-emoji`: Disable emoji in the output

   pip install web3

## Notes

Works on Mainnet, Sepolia, and other EVM networks.
If the transaction is still pending, the script will exit gracefully.
Gas price may vary depending on EIP-1559 vs legacy type.
The fee and confirmation count are live data points; they can change slightly as new blocks are mined.
For cross-checking soundness across providers, rerun the script with a second RPC and compare output values.
